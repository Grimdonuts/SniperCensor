To install this mode move it to the ModResource folder.
Directories should look like this:
 Psychonauts -> ModResource -> SniperCensor -> Localization,  Scripts, Textures, mod_boot.lua
After that update your astralathe_mods.txt in the main Psychonauts directory to have SniperCensor on a line

You will find the item in your inventory, use the item to shoot.
